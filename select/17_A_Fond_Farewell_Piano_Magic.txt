Oh lord
I've lost the one i love
I gave her all i had
But that was not enough
Oh lord
I cannot bear to breathe
Her voice is but a memory
Her kiss is but a dream
So long
I haven't left my bed
I see no point in getting up
I wish that I were dead
So long
I bid a fond farewell
I cannot live this hollow life
I cannot break her spell
